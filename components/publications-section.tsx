      description:
        "This paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as a philosophical and computational framework that explores how understanding can emerge in intelligent systems. Rather than asking what intelligence is, SCL asks under what structural conditions cognition becomes possible.",

        "Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic understanding, revealing a fundamental philosophical gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This paper redefines intelligence as a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation rather than a possessed property.",

      description:
        "This paper deepens the argument that hallucination is an inevitable property of intelligent systems, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon entropy. It proposes a shift toward hallucination-aware architectures, recognizing hallucination as a structural condition of intelligence.",

        "This research proposes SCL as an alternative architecture that separates cognition, memory, and control functions. SCL achieves an average task success rate of 86.3%, compared with 70.5 to 76.8 percent for baselines, demonstrating enhanced reliability without larger models.",
